What is IOS Boilerplate
-----------------------

Is a code base for iOS projects. Current version provides

  - BaseViewController with methods for secure handling of async http requests
  - DictionaryHelper with methods for safe handling of collections
  - ImageManager: a class for downloading images asynchronously
  - FastCell (inspired on [Atebits implementation](http://nickharris.wordpress.com/2010/06/17/fast-uitableviewcell-with-a-uiwebview/)) is a base class for implementing custom UITableViewCells with fast scrolling.

The project contains some examples with the use of those utility classes.



It includes some third party software:

  - [ASIHTTPRequest](http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/)
  - [SVProgressHUD](https://github.com/samvermette/SVProgressHUD)
  - [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit)
